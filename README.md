# VPN_Hardware Verilog Module

This Verilog module implements a basic hardware structure for a VPN (Virtual Private Network) component.

## Description

The `VPN_Hardware` Verilog module serves as a foundational structure for VPN hardware. It showcases a simple state machine, encryption and decryption processes (illustrated with placeholders), and control logic. This code serves as a starting point and requires integration with complex encryption algorithms and networking protocols for practical VPN functionality.

## File Structure

- `VPN_Hardware.v`: Main Verilog module implementing basic VPN hardware logic.

## Usage

This Verilog code can be integrated and expanded upon to create custom VPN hardware. To utilize it effectively, connect it within a larger hardware design framework and incorporate advanced encryption and networking protocols.

## Instructions

To use this Verilog module:

1. Integrate `VPN_Hardware.v` within your Verilog project.
2. Extend functionality by implementing actual encryption and decryption algorithms.
3. Ensure compatibility and integration with your overall hardware design.

## Contribution

Contributions and enhancements to this basic structure are welcome. Feel free to expand, optimize, or integrate additional features and security measures to enhance VPN functionality.
